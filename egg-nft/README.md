# EggNFT - Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Also, this project was made possible through the [Alchemy documentation](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-create-an-nft) on how to create an NFT.

Here are the following steps needed for you to run this repository on your local machine:

```bash
npm install
```

Once installation succeeds, copy the `.env.example` file and make your own `.env` file and paste the contents. Then, you need to update your variables. You'll get those environment variables by following the steps from this doc.

//TODO

Next, once your `.env` is in place, run the following command to deploy your own NFT Smart Contract:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
